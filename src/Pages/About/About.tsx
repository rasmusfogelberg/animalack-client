        where to change them. Or if you notice that you walk your dog way less than thought.

              Hello there! My name is Rasmus and I made this site.

            The idea for Animalack started when I noticed my cat wouldn't always
            eat her meals. I spent a lot of time tracking her eating habits and
            how much she ate. It was after a visit to the veterinarian that it
            was discovered that she has FORL (feline odontoclastic resorption
            lesion). Some of her front lower teeth were loose and caused her
            pain. Thanks to the help of the veterinarian she got her bad teeth
            removed and after a few weeks of medication she is back to her old
            self. During her recovery period she had to take medicine and an app
            like Animalack would have made it much easier to keep track of when
            and how much she was supposed to have. And that is when I started to
            think of Animalack. There are still many features that needs to be
            added. But Rome wasnâ€™t built in one day!
